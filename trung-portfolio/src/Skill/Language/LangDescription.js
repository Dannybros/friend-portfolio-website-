            I have an excellent English fluency as I have been studying it since 2016, the my start of middle school.
            I had bit of experience learing Chinese during my high-school but as I was quite busy doing other stuff,
            I couldn't caught onto it.
            <br/> <br/>
            I had opportunity to hang out with few of japanese guys and that's where I have learned bit of Japanese. Later
            with help of reading Japanese cartoon, I was able to widen my Japanese ability. <br/>
            Living in Laos, I naturally got hang of Lao language. Although I never went to Lao school or read lao, I can 
            still speak and understand lao
            <br/> <br/>
            Of course, I am currently living in Thai and studying Thai language as mandatory course. I'm confident I can at 
            least able to speak Thai with natives.
